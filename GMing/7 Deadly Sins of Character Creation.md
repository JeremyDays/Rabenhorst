#### CATEGORY 1: SUSTAINABILITY MISTAKES

##### 1. The One-Note Character

**The Sin:** Creating a character defined by a single personality trait that dominates their every interaction (the always-angry barbarian, the perpetually suspicious rogue, the constantly flirtatious bard).

**The Problem:** Characters who lean on only one trait become predictable and exhausting in longterm play. Your party members begin to anticipate your reactions, and what was once amusing can quickly become annoying.

**The Fix:** 
- Give your character at least three distinct personality traits, ideally ones that sometimes conflict with each other. 
- Ensure quirks are tied to specific triggers, not constant behaviors.

**Example:** Instead of playing a paladin who's
- always righteous and judgmental, 
consider one who:

- Upholds justice and honor in public matters
- Struggles with personal insecurities about their worthiness
- Has a soft spot for orphaned children due to their own background
- Only becomes severely judgmental when facing those who harm the innocent

Now you have a character with depth who can react differently based on the situation.

##### 2. The Backstory Blunder

**The Sin:** Creating an overwritten backstory that resolves all character development before the campaign even begins.

**The Problem:** An elaborate backstory can inadvertently end your character's growth arc before the first die is rolled! When a character has already experienced every emotional journey possible, there's nowhere left to go.

**The Fix:** 
- Focus on one or two impactful events that shaped your character. 
- Intentionally leave questions unanswered and 
- build future goals into your backstory to resolve during play.

**Example:** Instead of a wizard who:
- Mastered forbidden magic
- Defeated their evil mentor
- Restored their family honor
- Already achieved recognition as a prominent arcane scholar

Try a wizard who:
- Lost their mentor under mysterious circumstances
- Discovered a cryptic note suggesting a conspiracy among a group of arcane practitioners
- Seeks knowledge not for its own sake, but to uncover the truth
- Has a strained relationship with their family who disapproves of their magical pursuits

The second concept has built-in hooks for the DM and room for significant character development.


##### 8. The Static Relationships Builder

**The Sin:** Creating a character who forms one type of relationship with everyone they meet and never evolves these connections.

**The Problem:** Characters who approach all relationships the same way (always distrustful, overly friendly to everyone, or treating all NPCs as disposable) miss rich opportunities for storytelling and character development. When relationships don't evolve, the social dimension of the game becomes flat.

**The Fix:** 
- Design your character to form different types of relationships based on their values and experiences. 
- Allow these relationships to change over time in response to shared experiences.

**Example:** Instead of a character who:
- Treats every NPC with the same level of suspicion
- Forms identical relationships with all party members
- Never changes their opinion of someone once formed
- Has no meaningful relationship growth arc

Create a character who:
- Has specific trust triggers that determine initial reactions
- Forms unique dynamics with each party member based on shared values or contrasting perspectives
- Keeps a mental "relationship ledger" that evolves based on interactions
- Has the capacity to be profoundly


#### CATEGORY 2: SOCIAL INTEGRATION MISTAKES

##### 3. The Lone Wolf Syndrome

**The Sin:** Creating a character with no compelling reason to work with others or be part of an adventuring party.

**The Problem:** D&D is fundamentally collaborative. A character who constantly questions why they're with the group undermines the party dynamic and creates unnecessary tension.

**The Fix:** 
- Build personal or ideological motivations that tie your character to group cooperation. 
- Give them a reason to care about the success of others.

**Example:** Instead of a rogue who:
- Trusts no one and works alone
- Refuses to share information with the party
- Takes unnecessary risks without consulting others
- Is only in it for personal gain

Create a rogue who:
- Learned the hard way that some jobs are impossible alone
- Has a personal code about loyalty to those who fight alongside them
- Still likes to scout ahead but always reports findings to the group
- Has a specific goal that requires the diverse skills found in an adventuring party

##### 4. The Spotlight Hog

**The Sin:** Designing a character who needs to be the center of attention in every scene and situation.

**The Problem:** Constant spotlight-seeking stifles other players' moments to shine and disrupts the natural flow and pacing of the game.

**The Fix:** 
- Actively look for ways to redirect attention to other characters. 
- Build supporting elements into your concept that elevate the group rather than overshadow them.

Example: Instead of a bard who:
- Interrupts others' dialogue to insert witty comments
- Tries to handle every social interaction
- Takes credit for group achievements
- Makes every story about themselves 
Create a bard who:
- Uses their charisma to highlight others' accomplishments
- Creates songs about their companions' heroic deeds
- Knows when to step forward (like when facing nobility) and when to step back
- Takes genuine interest in others' stories and helps them tell their tales

##### 5. The Morality Mismatch

**The Sin:** Playing a character whose moral framework is fundamentally incompatible with the rest of the party.

**The Problem:** Creates constant tension that breaks immersion and can lead to party conflict that spills over into player frustration.

**The Fix:** 
- Ensure your character's moral framework allows for party cohesion, even if they don't always agree on methods. 
- Leave room for moral growth and compromise.

**Example:** Instead of a lawful good cleric in a morally ambiguous party who:
- Lectures the party after every questionable decision
- Threatens to leave the group over moral disagreements
- Reports party members to authorities
- Refuses to help with plans that don't meet their ethical standards

Create a cleric who:
- Believes in redemption and sees their presence in the group as a positive influence
- Offers alternatives rather than condemnation
- Understands that different backgrounds lead to different perspectives
- Has their own moral gray areas that create interesting tensions

#### CATEGORY 3: POWER-NARRATIVE BALANCE MISTAKES

##### 6. The Mechanically Handicapped Build

**The Sin:** Creating a character with an interesting concept but poor mechanical execution that prevents effective participation in gameplay.

**The Problem:** No matter how fascinating your character concept, if they consistently fail at what they attempt to do, both you and your party will grow frustrated.

**The Fix:** 
- Match your class mechanics with your concept. 
- Make sure the build will function well in the game's mechanical framework while supporting the narrative elements you want to explore.

**Example:** Instead of a "pacifist" fighter who:
- Refuses to deal damage
- Did not choose any martial feat
- Has a low strength score because “they’re a warrior because it’s family tradition but were not born strong”
- Becomes useless during inevitable combat encounters

Consider a peace domain cleric who:
- Focuses on buffing allies and debuffing enemies
- Has persuasion and deception skills to avoid combat when possible
- Can contribute meaningfully when diplomatic solutions fail
- Has mechanics that match their philosophical approach

##### 7. The Inflexible Concept

**The Sin:** Creating a character so rigidly defined that they refuse to evolve in response to campaign events ("My character would never...").

**The Problem:** Characters who resist growth become obstacles to the story and limit player enjoyment as the campaign progresses.

**The Fix:** 
- Build potential growth arcs and change triggers into your initial design. 
- Allow your character to respond organically to game events and evolve throughout play.

**Example:** Instead of a druid who:
- Has rigid, unbending views about civilization and nature
- Reacts the same way to every situation involving their core beliefs
- Uses "my character wouldn't do that" to avoid engaging with plot points
- Refuses to adapt even after transformative experiences

Create a druid who:
- Has strong initial beliefs but recognizes they have more to learn
- Identifies specific experiences that might change their perspective
- Has internal conflicts about certain aspects of their worldview
- Shows curiosity about alternatives even while maintaining core values

##### 9. The Ungrounded Character

**The Sin:** Creating a character whose abilities, knowledge, or attitudes don't reflect their stated background and experiences.

**The Problem:** When a character's backstory doesn't align with how they behave or what they know, it creates cognitive dissonance that breaks immersion and hurts narrative credibility. A farm boy who somehow knows court etiquette or a sheltered noble who's inexplicably streetwise creates confusion rather than depth.

**The Fix:** 
- Ensure your character's skills, knowledge, and worldview authentically reflect their background. 
- When you want exceptions, build specific experiences into their history that explain these anomalies.

**Example:** Instead of a farmer-turned-wizard who:
- Somehow knows multiple languages despite never leaving home
- Can navigate high society perfectly without explanation
- Shows no cultural quirks from their rural background

Create a character who:
- Still uses farming metaphors when explaining complex concepts
- Has a specific mentor who explains their unusual knowledge
- Shows appropriate awkwardness in unfamiliar situations
- Has skills that logically connect to their stated experiences
